\makecvtitle
Hello Pepa Atanasova, I am writing to apply for the PhD position in Interpretable Natural Language Processing. With a Master's degree in data science and applied mathematics, and 6 years of professional experience working with machine learning, I am excited to return to academia. I wish to pursue deep, curiosity-driven research to further my learning and your project research topic sounds interesting. 

\hspace*{2em}
Directly after my studies I continued work at RaySearch Laboratories in Stockholm with whom I had written my Master's thesis. My experience at RaySearch as a Data Science Researcher left a strong, long-lasting impression. I developed probabilistic and ML-based methods for radiotherapy planning of cancer treatment. The work was challenging and rewarding, and involved building custom autoencoders for computer vision. Though I had to leave Stockholm in 2021 to move to Copenhagen, my motivation to return to more research heavy work has only grown stronger. 

\hspace*{2em}
At RaySearch, but also later at Valcon, I used autoencoders to extract structure from complex, high-dimensional data, such as anatomical CT scans and complex invoicing agreements. These experiences taught me how latent representations can reveal meaningful internal organisation in otherwise difficult to use data. I am excited to see how similar approaches, particularly sparse autoencoders, are being used to interpret language models. I would be thrilled to bring this background into an NLP setting and contribute to methods that aim to make deep models more transparent.

\hspace*{2em}
I am drawn to your group's focus on interpreting machine learning models and uncovering structure in NLP models. I value theory-grounded approaches and enjoy a deep understanding of my work rather than accepting results at face-value. This is one of the reasons I am now seeking a role where I can contribute to foundational AI research rather than high-level applications.

\hspace*{2em}
Outside of work, I live right by the Botanical Gardens and would love the chance to contribute to a research group embedded in this part of Copenhagen. I fill my free time with designing furniture, woodworking,  coding, 3D-printing, climbing, road biking, ultimate frisbee, and board games, activities that keep my hands and mind sharp. I thoroughly enjoy picking up new skills and am self taught in all my hobbies. In my professional life, I now want to return to a research environment where I can follow ideas from early exploration to experimentation, refinement, and ultimately publication.

I hope to hear back from you soon. Regards,
