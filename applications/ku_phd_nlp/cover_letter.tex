Hello Stefan Sommer,

\hspace*{2em}
I am writing to apply for the PhD position in Data Science and Geometric Models of Morphology. With a Master's degree in data science and applied mathematics, and 6 years of professional experience working with machine learning, I am excited to return to academia. I wish to pursue deep, curiosity-driven research to further my learning and your project appears interesting. 

\hspace*{2em}
Directly after my studies I continued work at RaySearch Laboratories in Stockholm with whom I had written my Master's thesis. My experience at RaySearch as a Data Science Researcher left a strong, long-lasting impression. I developed probabilistic and ML-based methods for radiotherapy planning of cancer treatment. The work was rewarding and involved building custom deep neural networks for computer vision. It was challenging and deeply rewarding. I particularly enjoyed collaborating with clinicians and all that I learnt in my work there. Though I had to leave Stockholm in 2021 to move to Copenhagen, my motivation to return to more research heavy work has only grown stronger. 

\hspace*{2em}
I am drawn to MorphAI's and DIGIFABA's shared focus on modelling real-world structure---be it anatomical or agricultural---through statistical and machine learning based methods. I value theory-grounded approaches and enjoy building systems that reflect the structure of the world, rather than just fitting data. This is one of the reasons I am now seeking a role where I can contribute to AI research rather than high-level applications.

\hspace*{2em}
Outside of work, I live right by the Botanical Gardens and would love the chance to contribute to a research group embedded in this part of Copenhagen. I fill my free time with designing furniture, woodworking,  coding, 3D-printing, climbing, road biking, ultimate frisbee, and board games---activities that keep my hands and mind sharp. I thoroughly enjoy picking up new skills in different ways and want to do more of this in my professional life as well.

I hope to hear back from you soon. Regards,

Ivar Cashin Eriksson.
