\makecvtitle
Dear Tomislav Dragicevic, I am applying for the PhD position in \textit{Embedded Machine Learning for Demand Flexibility}. I wish to pursue deep, curiosity-driven research to further my learning. , and your research topic sounds like a good fit for me.

\hspace*{2em}
I hold a degree in Engineering Physics from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, a rigorous and mathematically demanding program. My studies combined mathematics with sciences, including everything from group theory to control theory. In my master's, I specialised in applied mathematics, earning a master's in Statistical Learning and Data Analytics (GPA 5.0/5.0). This track focused heavily on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, including deep learning. I thoroughly enjoyed understanding how ML models work under the hood, and this intellectual curiosity is what initially led me to pursue a career in data science. Now, I am eager to return to academia to deepen my understanding and help advance the field further.

\hspace*{2em}
I began my career at RaySearch Laboratories in Stockholm, where I also completed my master's thesis. As a Data Science Researcher, I developed probabilistic and computer vision-based ML methods for radiotherapy planning, including autoencoders and lexicographic optimisation. I collaborated closely with oncologists to ensure clinical relevance. Since moving to Copenhagen, I've worked as a Data Scientist across industries, designing real-time endt-to-end multi-modal ML systems and mentoring junior colleagues. These roles gave me a practical engineering perspective on end-to-end ML pipelines, an asset in research aimed at real-world impact.

\hspace*{2em}
Outside of work, I fill my free time with designing furniture, woodworking, coding, 3D-printing, climbing, road biking, ultimate frisbee, and board games, activities that keep my hands and mind sharp. I thoroughly enjoy picking up new skills and am self-taught in all my hobbies. In my professional life, I now want to return to a research environment where I can follow ideas from early exploration to experimentation, refinement, and ultimately publication. I find long-term, curiosity-driven projects deeply motivating, especially when they combine theory, technical implementation, and collaboration across disciplines. The intersection of embedded ML, control, and renewable energy systems excites me as it offers a chance to develop algorithms that directly improve the resilience and flexibility of the power grid.

I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your research group. Kind regards,
