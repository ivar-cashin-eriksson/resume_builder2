    In this personal project I am building an end-to-end computer vision system for making product images on e-commerce sites interactive. The pipeline detects individual items using a YOLOv8 or SAM2 model, and embeds them semantically using OpenCLIP. The embeddings are then compared to support intelligent product linking across all images and products in a web store.
    \newline\hspace*{2em}
    The system includes a full-stack setup with a FastAPI backend, MongoDB for persistence, a FAISS index for fast vector search, and a custom-built Chromium plug-in that overlays clickable links directly onto web shop imagery in real-time. The project also includes a dynamic scraping and indexing pipeline for ingesting and structuring product data from arbitrary e-commerce sites.
    \newline\hspace*{2em}
    The project has been a learning opportunity for fine-tuning of deep learning models and practical ML engineering.
