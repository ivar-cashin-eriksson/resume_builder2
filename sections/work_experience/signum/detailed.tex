    At Signum, I maintain and lead development on Kwarts, a next-best-action engine for pharmaceutical sales. Originally built externally, I now own the system, extending it with features like explainable AI in collaboration with UX designers, and supporting its commercialisation by aiding our sales representatives. Kwarts adapts to varied customer data maturity, from rule-based logic to deep learning, and is deployed in AWS for scalability.
    \newline\hspace*{2em}
    I also maintain and improve our pharmaceutical price forecasting model, which helps clients navigate Denmark's fortnightly blind auctions. After stabilising the XGBoost-based system, I am now driving efforts toward a more robust and modern implementation.
    \newline\hspace*{2em}
    Beyond model development, I have also organised an internal week-long hackathon that included up to 40 participants. The event fostered innovation and collaboration, resulting in several new ideas and prototypes.
