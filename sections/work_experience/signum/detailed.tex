    At Signum, I maintain and lead development on Kwarts, a next-best-action engine for pharmaceutical sales. Originally built externally, I now own the system internally -- extending it with features like explainable AI in collaboration with UX designers, and supporting its commercialisation by contributing to sales material. Kwarts adapts to varied customer data maturity, from rule-based logic to deep learning, and is deployed in AWS for scalability.
    \newline\hspace*{2em}
    I also maintain and improve our pharmaceutical price forecasting model, which helps clients navigate Denmark's fortnightly blind auctions. After stabilising the XGBoost-based system, I am now driving efforts toward a more modern, user-focused version.
    \newline\hspace*{2em}
    Beyond model development, I am also organising an internal week-long hackathon involving up to 40 participants.
