\cventry{2022--2024}{Principal Data Scientist}{Valcon}{Copenhagen}{}{
    Led data science projects across pharma, energy, IoT, and manufacturing. Mentored junior colleagues, led xAI and Git trainings, and shaped internal practices. Regularly presented to non-technical stakeholders, honing my ability to translate complex ideas clearly.

    One project involved training a real-time deep neural network with an advanced custom training pipeline and modular architecture. The training data consisted of natural-language and high dimensional multi-class labels which made for a challenging prediction problem. I was the lead data scientist and architect of the solution and responsible for implementing the end-to-end in-production pipeline.

    I was awarded the "Valcon People's Choice Award" for exemplary work, leadership, team spirit, and scientific curiosity.
